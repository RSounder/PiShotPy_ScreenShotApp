Problem Statement:
WE would have to use the terminal to install and deploy the screen shot packages and commands.
This usually took four to five steps. The aim of this app is to simplify your efforts into a GUI and save time. 

Usage:
1) Run the GUI by double-clicking on it 
2) Select if you want the screen shot to be taken at that instant or after a delay time 
3) Note that the PiSHotPy app will be not be included in the QuickShot process
4) If you select the Screen Shot with delay option, select if you want the screen shot to be taken after user-defined or built-in number of seconds.
5) Note that there are 5,10 and 20 second options available in the Screen Shot via Built-in delay option 
6) If you choose to specify the delay time in seconds, Enter it in the text box and the screen shot will be taken in the specified time.


That's pretty much it!
